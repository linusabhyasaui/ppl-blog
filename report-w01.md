--- As A Scrum Master ---

Working on this project as the Scrum Master I have picked up on several skills which are important for a Scrum Master.

1. Team Management

What I mean by team management is that you need to be able to communicate with all your team members effectively. Especially at the beginning of a project so that they understand the scope of the project and what is required of them. This is also where you need to be able to make compromises about the project if there are team members who are unable to work with a certain systems. You must also learn to take feed back from your team and present it to the Product owner in a way that they can understand, whilst also denying unreasonable requests.


2. Repo management

You need to understand how to build repos which help with the Scrum process, this depends on what repo managing system you use. For an example for the LIDAR project we are using GitLab Enterprise. For those using GitLab Enterprise, the tips I have for you are:

> Use the Epics Feature: Will help in managing which epic each issue is tied to. Also gives you Epic Burndown Charts!

> Use the Sprint/Iterations Feature: Will help you keep track of work done during each sprint. Also gives you epic Burndown Charts!

> Use the Issue system and Issue resolved by commit/pull request: Makes it easier to track which issue has been finished, less work in the long run. Also helps with your epic Burndown Charts!

~I Like Pretty Burndown Charts (^-^)


3. Understanding how Scrum Works

This is self explanatory but this is how I'll explain it. 

> Scrum has a workflow, Branch feature -> Pull request to dev -> repeat until sprint end then merge with pull request, 

> Daily Stand up Meetings where you only ask 3 questions and don't discuss anything but break off into smaller groups where you can discuss your problems

> Each merge must be a functional and deployable system (*Does not apply to all repositories if your project is split into multiple*)


--- As A Developer ---

Working as a developer on this project I have suffered the fate of:

1. Someone trying to reverse engineer a system with little to no documentation
2. Someone trying to set up a docker system for a project which they have no clear idea of the structure
3. Someone trying to make time in a time constrained environment where there are multiple simultaneous projects running at the same time, where they are needed in all of them
